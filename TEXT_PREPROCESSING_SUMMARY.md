# Text Preprocessing Pipeline - Results Summary

## Overview
Successfully applied comprehensive text preprocessing to all sentiment analysis datasets. The pipeline transformed raw, noisy text into clean, standardized format suitable for machine learning models.

## Preprocessing Pipeline Steps

### 1. ✅ Lowercase Conversion
- **What**: Converted all text to lowercase
- **Why**: Ensures "Great", "great", and "GREAT" are treated as the same word
- **Example**: "I am a HUGE @Borderlands fan" → "i am a huge @borderlands fan"

### 2. ✅ URL, Mention, and Hashtag Symbol Removal
- **What**: Removed URLs, user mentions, and hashtag symbols while preserving hashtag words
- **Why**: URLs and mentions are noise; hashtag words contain sentiment
- **Examples**:
  - URLs: `pic.twitter.com/mLsI5wf9Jg` → removed
  - Mentions: `@VirginAmerica` → removed
  - Hashtags: `#BeforeTheFlood` → `beforetheflood`

### 3. ✅ Special Character, Number, and Punctuation Removal
- **What**: Removed everything except letters and spaces
- **Why**: Simplifies text to core words for Bag-of-Words models
- **Example**: "It's amazing!!!" → "its amazing"

### 4. ✅ Tokenization
- **What**: Split text into individual words
- **Why**: Necessary for stopword removal and lemmatization
- **Example**: "climate change interesting" → ["climate", "change", "interesting"]

### 5. ✅ Stopword Removal
- **What**: Removed common words with little sentiment value
- **Why**: Focuses model on sentiment-carrying words
- **Removed**: "a", "an", "the", "is", "in", "on", "rt", "via", "amp", etc.

### 6. ✅ Lemmatization
- **What**: Reduced words to base form
- **Why**: Consolidates word variations into single tokens
- **Examples**: "running" → "run", "better" → "good", "characters" → "character"

### 7. ✅ Token Rejoining
- **What**: Combined cleaned tokens back into strings
- **Why**: Standard format for vectorizers (CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer)

| Dataset | Original Rows | Cleaned Rows | Removed | Processing Time |
|---------|---------------|--------------|---------|-----------------|
| Borderlands | 73,824 | 72,218 | 1,606 | 9.16s |
| Airline | 14,640 | 14,612 | 28 | 1.33s |
| Climate | 43,943 | 43,914 | 29 | 4.29s |
| Corona | 44,955 | 44,917 | 38 | 6.97s |
| **Combined** | **177,362** | **175,661** | **1,701** | **19.88s** |

### Text Quality Improvements

#### Before Preprocessing Examples:
```
Original: "So I spent a few hours making something for fun. . . If you don't know I am a HUGE @Borderlands fan and Maya is one of my favorite characters. So I decided to make myself a wallpaper for my PC. . Here is the original image versus the creation I made :) Enjoy! pic.twitter.com/mLsI5wf9Jg"

Original: "@VirginAmerica plus you've added commercials to the experience... tacky."

Original: "RT @NatGeoChannel: Watch #BeforeTheFlood right here, as @LeoDiCaprio travels the world to tackle #climate change https://t.co/LkDehj3tNn"
```

#### After Preprocessing Examples:
```
Cleaned: "spent hour making something fun know huge fan maya one favorite character decided make wallpaper pc original image versus creation made enjoy"

Cleaned: "plus added commercial experience tacky"

Cleaned: "watch beforetheflood right travel world tackle climate change"
```

### Sentiment Distribution (Combined Dataset)

| Neutral | 58,568 | 33.3% |
| Negative | 52,054 | 29.6% |
| **Total** | **175,661** | **100%** |

### Text Length Statistics

|---------|----------------------------|
| Borderlands | 67.7 characters |
| Airline | 55.0 characters |
| Climate | 66.3 characters |
| Corona | 125.4 characters |
| **Combined** | **81.1 characters** |

## Noise Removal Success

### ✅ Successfully Removed:
- **URLs**: `pic.twitter.com/...`, `https://t.co/...`
- **Mentions**: `@VirginAmerica`, `@Borderlands`, `@NatGeoChannel`
- **Hashtag Symbols**: `#BeforeTheFlood` → `beforetheflood`
- **Punctuation**: `.`, `,`, `!`, `?`, `...`
- **Special Tokens**: `<unk>`, `&amp;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`
- **Numbers**: `2`, `30`, `15`
- **Stopwords**: `I`, `am`, `a`, `the`, `is`, `in`, `on`, `rt`, `via`

### ✅ Successfully Preserved:
- **Sentiment Words**: `love`, `hate`, `amazing`, `terrible`, `awesome`
- **Hashtag Words**: `beforetheflood`, `climate`, `coronavirus`
- **Meaningful Content**: All sentiment-carrying words and phrases

## Output Files

All cleaned datasets are saved in the `cleaned_datasets/` folder:

1. `processed_dataset_1_borderlands.csv` - 72,218 rows
2. `processed_dataset_2_airline.csv` - 14,612 rows
3. `processed_dataset_3_climate.csv` - 43,914 rows
4. `processed_dataset_4_corona.csv` - 44,917 rows
5. `combined_sentiment_dataset.csv` - 175,661 rows

Each file contains three columns:
- `sentiment`: The sentiment label (positive, negative, neutral)
- `text`: Original raw text
- `clean_text`: Preprocessed, cleaned text

## Quality Validation
