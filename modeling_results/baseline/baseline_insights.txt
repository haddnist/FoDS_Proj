- Worst performing dataset: Combined (F1: 0.6631)
- Performance variation: 0.1092

CLASS IMBALANCE IMPACT:
- Borderlands: 41.8% majority class
- Airline: 62.7% majority class
- Climate: 52.3% majority class
- Corona: 43.6% majority class
- Combined: 37.0% majority class

COMMON MISCLASSIFICATION PATTERNS:
- Borderlands: Most common error is neutral → positive (1026 cases)
- Airline: Most common error is negative → neutral (357 cases)
- Climate: Most common error is positive → neutral (1050 cases)

BASELINE MODEL STRENGTHS:
- Simple and interpretable (Logistic Regression)
- Fast training and prediction
- Good performance on balanced datasets
- Handles class imbalance with balanced class weights

BASELINE MODEL WEAKNESSES:
- Limited by Bag-of-Words representation (no word order)
- Struggles with class imbalance in some datasets
- No consideration of word relationships or context
- Vocabulary limited to most frequent 5,000 words
- May overfit to frequent words

IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES:
- Use TF-IDF instead of raw counts
- Include n-grams (bigrams, trigrams)
- Try more sophisticated models (SVM, Random Forest)
- Use word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
- Implement ensemble methods
